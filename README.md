# Database-Driven Web Application for Game Information Collection and Analysis

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application developed to help players search and analyze data from game tournaments. Built using **React** for the front-end and **Node.js** for the back-end, the application allows users to retrieve, analyze, and visualize data related to tournaments. The application is backed by a **MySQL** database hosted on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, designed to store game statistics and tournament information.

Key features include:
- **Full-Stack Web Application**: Developed using React and Node.js.
- **MySQL Database**: Deployed on GCP to store and manage data from game tournaments.
- **Data Analysis**: Algorithms designed to analyze game data, providing insights on optimal champions and strategies for players.

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Players can search through tournament data to find relevant statistics.
- **Data Analysis**: The system analyzes the collected data to suggest optimal champions and strategies for different game scenarios.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The React front-end provides an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed for running the server.
- **MySQL**: MySQL server should be set up and connected to the Google Cloud Platform.
- **Google Cloud Platform Account**: Necessary to deploy the MySQL database and host the web application.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Add advanced data visualization tools to provide deeper insights into game data.
- **Real-Time Data**: Integrate real-time tournament data collection and analysis.
- **Recommendation System**: Implement a recommendation engine to suggest personalized strategies for players.
